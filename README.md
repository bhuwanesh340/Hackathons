# Hackathons
The repository contains my solution of various hackathons conducted on different portals.

There are various platforms which conduct hackathons and personally I feel hackthons are great becaus of following reasons:

<b> 1. Showcase Your Skills </b>

While hackathons are a great a way for everyone to meet and collaborate with others in their field of expertise, there’s also a competitive side. Hackathons challenge attendees to exhibit their ability to innovate and create compelling, real-world solutions.

<b> 2. Learn About Tech </b>

One of the biggest benefits of attending a hackathon is learning new skills and attaining new knowledge. 

<b> 3. Share Your Ideas </b>

At its heart, a hackathon is a deeply collaborative effort. To get the most out of these events, attendees need to be willing to share their expertise with others, ensuring that everyone learns from everyone else.

<b> 4. Challenge Yourself </b>

It can be very easy to remain in your comfort zone, doing things you know how to do and never really challenging yourself. At hackathons, there is no such safe space. You will be constantly challenged to push yourself and move outside your comfort zone.

<b> 5. Collaborate Under Pressure </b>

It may not sound like a selling point, but experiencing the pressure of having to come together with people you don’t know and create something entirely new in a very short space of time can be hugely rewarding. You don’t simply get a sense of achievement from completing the task — you also learn how to work efficiently, how to work as a team and how you can put your skills to work in a quick-turn environment.
